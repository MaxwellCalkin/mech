# Agent Instructions

This repository contains a small educational video game written in Python using Pygame.

## Development Guidelines

- Check for syntax errors with:
  ```bash
  python -m py_compile $(git ls-files '*.py')
  ```
- Keep documentation in Markdown under `docs/`.
- Update this AGENTS file as the project evolves.
