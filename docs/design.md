# Mechanistic Mech Arena Design Document

## Overview
Mechanistic Mech Arena is a chapter-based action game where each chapter
teaches a new concept in mechanistic interpretability through narrative and
combat. Players pilot a mech suit and must defeat bosses that embody key
concepts.

## Chapters
1. **Signal Flow** - Learn how information propagates in neural networks.
   - Boss: "The Gradient Ghost"
2. **Attention Mechanics** - Understand attention heads and their roles.
   - Boss: "Captain Context"
3. **Circuit Construction** - Discover how circuits combine to produce
   behavior.
   - Boss: "The Circuit Smasher"
4. **Scaling Laws** - Explore how model performance scales with size.
   - Boss: "Lord Log-Log"
5. **Tooling & Experiments** - Practice with real interpretability tools.
   - Boss: "The Inspector"

## Teaching Approach
Narrative dialog introduces each concept. During battles, gameplay reinforces the
idea with mechanics tied to the lesson (e.g., using attention beams to expose
weaknesses).

## Implementation Plan
1. Create a basic Pygame window and mech movement controls.
2. Implement a level system with placeholders for chapters.
3. Integrate dialog boxes for story text.
4. Add combat mechanics and simple enemy AI.
5. Flesh out bosses with unique attacks that illustrate the concept.
6. Iterate with art and sound assets.
